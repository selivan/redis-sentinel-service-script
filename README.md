**UPD** Init script appeared in packages from ppa:chris-lea/redis-server since redis version 3.2.

SysV init script for redis-sentinel. redis-server package doesn't have one. Uses `start-stop-daemon`, works only in Debian/Ubuntu.

**P.S.** If this code is useful for you - don't forget to put a star on it's [github repo](https://github.com/selivan/redis-sentinel-sysv-service).
